lab for CS347

PART 1:
I'm doing this lab on my own after the fact since I've been sick the past few days.

I created the new text file through my file list in VScode, wrote in it, and saved it. Then I opened the terminal and did
    git add ./newFile.txt
    git commit

but I was having issues with how VScode wanted me to enter the commit message, but in the interest of quick solutions I remembered I could just do 
    git commit -m "[messsage]"

instead
then of course 
        git push
